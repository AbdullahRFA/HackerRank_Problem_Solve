"""
zip([iterable, ...])

This function returns a list of tuples. The th tuple contains the th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables.

If the argument sequences are of unequal lengths, then the returned list is truncated to the length of the shortest argument sequence.

Sample Code

>>> print zip([1,2,3,4,5,6],'Hacker')
[(1, 'H'), (2, 'a'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'k'), (5, 'e'), (6, 'r')]
>>>
>>> print zip([1,2,3,4,5,6],[0,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1])
[(1, 0), (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6), (6, 5)]
>>>
>>> A = [1,2,3]
>>> B = [6,5,4]
>>> C = [7,8,9]
>>> X = [A] + [B] + [C]
>>>
>>> print zip(*X)
[(1, 6, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 4, 9)]
Task

Subject 3   |  91    92    83    89    90.5
            |______________________________
Average        90    91    82    90    85.5
Input Format

The first line contains  and  separated by a space.
The next  lines contains the space separated marks obtained by students in a particular subject.

Constraints
